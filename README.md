# Ellie, a discord bot designed for Kingdoms.

I would not recommend hosting this bot yourself as it is designed for our usecases. Our databse is hosted on SQLite, I'm sure you infer the types from the code. If anybody really cares, I can probably make it create the db automatically.
Everything you need to set the bot up is in .env
I had a lot of magic numbers that I tried to add the .env, if I missed anything please create an issue.

Fun fact: Kingdoms originally had Geyser and therefore the entire whitelist system was different.
